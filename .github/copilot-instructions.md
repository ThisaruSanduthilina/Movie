This project is a Vue 3 + Vite web application for a movie site layout. Use only vanilla JavaScript and CSS (no frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, jQuery, or TypeScript). Each main section (Header, Hero, Introduction, MovieGrid, ContactMap, Footer) should be a separate Vue component. Follow accessibility and responsive best practices. Use assets from the /src/assets directory.
